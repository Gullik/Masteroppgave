\section{Numerical Simulations}
	As there are several theoretical branches within the field of plasma physics,
	magnetohydrodynamics, kinetic theory (Note to self:  Need better overview, and citations),
	that are suited to investigate plasma physics at different scales and different phenonema,
	there are also different approaches to conduct numerical plasma studies.
	Plasma simulation codes can be classified along the extent they are particle based
	or fluid based. Fluid based programs use the magnetohydrodynamical equations,



	\section{Particle-in-Cell}
	 To investigate the mechanics involved in a wide variety of plasma phenomenens,
	 computer simulation. Particle-in-Cell, PiC, is simulation model that takes a
	 particle based approach, where each particle is simulated seperately, or a
	 collection. If we naively would attempt to compute the electrical force between each particle, the necessary
	 computational power would grow quickly as the number of particle increases, \(\order{(\#particles)^2}\).
	 Since a large number of particles is often neccessary the PiC method seeks to
	 the problem by computing the electrical field produces by the particles, and then
	 compute the force on the particle directly from the field instead. From the charge
	 distribution we can find the electric potential through the use of Poissons
	 equation, \cref{eq:poisson}, and subsequently find the electrical field from
	 the electrical potential. See \cref{fig:schematic} for an overview of the

		\begin{align}
			\nabla ^2 \Phi &= -\rho \qquad \text{in} \qquad \Omega \label{eq:poisson}
		\end{align}

		% Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
