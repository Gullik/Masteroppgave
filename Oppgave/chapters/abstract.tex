	This thesis is about the development of a parallel multigrid solver to the
	Particle-in-Cell program PINC. The workings of the multigrid solver is
	described as well the most important parts of PINC. The solver is
	confirmed to work accurately on various test cases. The convergence rate
	of the algorithm was found to be between \(0.149\) and \(0.203\) for various grid sizes.
	A Langmuir oscillation was simulated with the PINC, where it performed the expected
 	number of oscillations confirming that the program as a whole works.
