	Now we will describe the PiC code, PINC, which part of was developed as
	a part of this work. Some of the neat features of PINC include the ability
	to change modules without recompiling, full N-dimensional functions as well
	as special 3-dimensional functions and built in modularity. Presently PINC is
	not publicly available, but ask the 4DSpace at UiO for access.
