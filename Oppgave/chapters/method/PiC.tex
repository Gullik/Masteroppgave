\section{Particle-in-Cell}
 To investigate the mechanics involved in a wide variety of plasma phenomenens,
 computer simulation. Particle-in-Cell, PiC, is simulation model that takes a
 particle based approach, where each particle is simulated seperately, or a
 collection. If we naively would attempt to compute the electrical force between each particle, the necessary
 computational power would grow quickly as the number of particle increases, \(\order{(\#particles)^2}\).
 Since a large number of particles is often neccessary the PiC method seeks to
 the problem by computing the electrical field produces by the particles, and then
 compute the force on the particle directly from the field instead. From the charge
 distribution we can find the electric potential through the use of Poissons
 equation, \cref{eq:poisson}, and subsequently find the electrical field from
 the electrical potential. See \cref{fig:schematic} for an overview of the

    \begin{align}
        \nabla ^2 \Phi &= -\rho \qquad \text{in} \qquad \Omega \label{eq:poisson}
    \end{align}

    % The problem also need boundary conditions in which we will focus on periodic,
    % Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
