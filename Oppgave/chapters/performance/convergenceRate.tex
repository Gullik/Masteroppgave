\subsection{Convergence Rate}
	As an iterative solver a multigrid solver will gradually approach a solution,
	reducing the residual further each run. In this subsection we will measure the convergence
	rate, defined in similar way as in \citet{zhukov_parallel_2014},
	%
	\begin{equation}
		p = \left(\frac{r_m}{r_0}\right)^{1/m}
	\end{equation}
	%
	where \(r_m, r_0\) are the \(2\)-norm of a the residual after \(m\) multigrid runs
 	and the inital residual. We presume that each run of the multigrid solver will
	remove a proportion of the remaining residual.
	The tests are done on a \(128^3\) grid on a sinusoidal
	problem, and the smoothers run for an equal number of runs on each level.

	\citeauthor{zhukov_parallel_2014} found convergence rates of \(p \approx 0.15\) and \(p \approx 0.17\)
	using a multigrid solver with a Chebyshev algorithm to smooth.
