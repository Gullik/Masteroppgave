  \subsection{Perfomance Optimizer}
    A multigrid solver has several parameters that needs to be set correctly for
    a an optimal performance. These parameters are dependent on the problem size,
    as well as the computing architecture. Instead of attempting to estimate them beforehand
    we have included an external script that runs the program with different MG-solver
    settings on the wanted domain size and tries to optimize them, see \cref{sec:optimizer}.
    The parameters it tries to change is the number of grid levels and the cycles
    to run for presmoothing, postsmoothing and the coarse solver. It should be worth it
    to spend some computing power, finding close to optimal settings,  prior to
    running a full scale simulation since the solver needs to run each time step.
    The performance optimizer naively runs the solver for a predetermined mesh of
    settings.
