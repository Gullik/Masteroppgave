\subsection{Scaling Multigrid vs PINC}
	As well as the scaling properties of the multigrid solver a look at the
	whole PiC model is interesting. This helps us easier pinpoint where further
	optimizations efforts should be directed. We do not necessarilly except the
	the particle based algorithms to scale up to larger problems in the same
	rate as	the solver. So above a certain number of processors, or size, there may
	be a bottleneck.
