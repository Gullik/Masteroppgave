\section{Scaling}
  In this section we investigate the performance of the solver and different scaling
  measurements. We are interested in both how well the solver performs on a larger
  number of processors, as well as the perfomance impact of the different
  parameters in the solver.

  We want to obtain a better understanding of how the field resolution can be scaled
  up without hampering the perfomance of the particle-in-cell simulation to much.
