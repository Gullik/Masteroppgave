Here is a list of what possible improvements and extensions that we hope
is eventually developed in our PinC program. Our aim was to develop a solid, basic
and easy to use parallel PiC program, that is suited to further development. Our hope
is that this project eventually develops into a full scale open source PiC program.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Objects
    \item Adaptive mesh
    \item Realtime plasma vizualizations (ala Atomify)
    \item Full Electromagnetic PiC
    \item Compatibility with FEM (dolphin) as a solver
    \item Hybrid, add on possibility of fluid-species and molecular dynamics
    \item Spectral Solvers (Wish that was available for testing of other solvers)
    \item Variable Ghost Layers
    \item Various stencils, interpolation and discretizations of different orders
\end{itemize}
