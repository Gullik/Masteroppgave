\section{Single Particle Motion}
	To better understand the collective motion of plasma it is useful to consider
	the motions of the single particles that the plasma consists of. By at first
	treating only one particle we can ignore the electromagnetic influence from
	the other particles which greatly simplifies the situation. The Lorentz
	force, \cref{eq:lorentz}, governs the dynamics of a charged particle in a plasma,
	provided that other forces, e.g. gravity, are neglible.
	The Lorentz force consist of a combination of the velocity, \(\vb{v}\), electric field, \(\vb{E}\), and
	magnetic field \(\vb{B}\).
 	\begin{align}
		\vb{F} = q\left(\vb{E} + \vb{v}\cross\vb{B}\right) \label{eq:lorentz}
	\end{align}
	To simplify matters we will only consider particles in static electromagnetic field,
	as that is often a valid approximation on the time and spatial scales of interest.

	\subsection{Gyration}
		\label{sec:gyration}
		Let us consider a situation with a single particle in a static and isotropic external
 		magnetic field, with an initial velocity, as in \citet{goldston_introduction_1995}.
		Newtons Second law together with \cref{eq:lorentz} then gives

		\begin{align}
			m\pdv{\vb{v}}{t} &= q\vb{v}\cross\vb{B} \label{eq:simple_gyration}
			\intertext{The velocity component parallel to the magnetic field is unaffected by the field and
			will remain constant. If we take perform a temporal differention on the
			perpendicular part we get}
			% So we will
			% seperate the velocity into a parallel and perpendicular velocity with respect to the magnetic field,
			% \(\vb{v}=\vb{v}_\parallel + \vb{v}_\perp\). The parallel motion is fully described by
			% \(\pdv{\vb{v}_\parallel}{t} = 0\).
			% We remove the parallel part and perform temporal derivative on the equation of motion to get }
			\pdv[2]{\vb{v}_\perp}{t} &= \frac{q}{m} \pdv{\vb{v}_\perp}{t}\cross \vb{B}
			\intertext{Then we insert \cref{eq:simple_gyration} into the equation and use the vector relation
			\( a\cross b\cross c = b(a\cdot b) - c(a\cdot b) \).}
			\pdv[2]{\vb{\omega}_\perp}{t} + \left(\frac{qB}{m}\right)^2\vb{\omega}_\perp &= 0
		\end{align}

			\end{subfigure}
		\end{figure}


		This differential equation corresponds to a gyration around the magnetic field lines
		with the gyration frequency, \(\omega_c = \frac{qB}{m}\), as the frequency.
		In the last equation we also changed the term describing the rotational motion
		to \(\vb{\omega}_\perp\), which is often used in plasma literature to
		signify gyration.

	\subsection{E-cross-B Drift}
	The E-cross-B drift happens when a particle is moving within static and isotrop
	electric and magnetic fields. The equation of motion, neglecting all forces
	except the electromagnetic, is then

	\begin{align}
		m\pdv{v}{t} &= q(\vb{E} + \vb{v}\cross\vb{B}) \label{eq:EcrossB}
	\end{align}

	As in the previous section we decompose the velocity into a parallel and perpendicular
 	velocity. We also assume there exists a constant drift \(\vb{v}_D\), somewhat unfounded at this stage,
	so that we can seperate the perpendicular motion into the drift and the gyration.
	The velocity is then given by \(\va{v} = \va{v}_\parallel + \va{\omega}_\perp + \va{v}_D\),
	and we insert this into the equation of motion.

	\begin{align}
		m\pdv{}{t}\left( \va{v}_\parallel + \va{\omega}_\perp + \va{v}_D\right) &=
		q \left( \va{E} +   \left( \va{v}_\parallel + \va{\omega}_\perp +
		\va{v}_D \right)  \cross \va{B}_0 \right)
	\end{align}

	
	As before the parallel velocity is unaffected by the magnetic field we subtract
	it from the equation. From \cref{sec:gyration} we know that the gyration
	part is given by

	\begin{align}
		m\pdv{\vb{\omega}_\perp}{t} &= q\vb{\vb{\omega}_\perp}\cross\vb{B}
	\end{align}

	After we have subtracted these two parts we are left with

	\begin{align}
		\pdv{\va{v}_D}{t} &= \frac{q}{m} \left( \va{E}_\perp + \va{v}_D \cross \va{B} \right)
	\end{align}

	Then we use the previous assumption that the drift velocity is constant,
	cross the equation with \(\vb{B}\) and perform some algebra, see \citet{goldston_introduction_1995},
	to arrive at

	\begin{align}
		\vb{v}_D &= \frac{\vb{E}\cross\vb{B}}{B^2}
	\end{align}

	As we can see the E-cross-B drift is independent of particle charge and mass,
	which means both the ions and electrons will be drifting at the same velocity
	subject to the drift which will be perpendicular to electric and magnetic fields.

	There several other types of drift, and motions, that appear in various configurations,
	that we will not go through here, i.e. gradient-B drift, curvature drift, polarization drift and magnetic mirror
	to mention a few.
