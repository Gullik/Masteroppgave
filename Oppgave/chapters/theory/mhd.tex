\section{Magnetohydrodynamics}
    In a plasma there are usually several types of species, then it follows that
    each specie needs its own set of fluid equations. Magnetohydrodynamics, (MDH),
    is an attempt to simplify this situation by combining it into one electrically
    conducting fluid. Conventional MHD assumes local thermodynamical equilibrium,
    negligable electron inertia and quasi-neutrality \citep{goldston_introduction_1995}.
