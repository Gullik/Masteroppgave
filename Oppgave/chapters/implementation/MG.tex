	When an iterative solver solves a problem, it starts with an initial guess then for each cycle it improves the guess to come closer to the
	wanted solution. The difference between the guess and the correct solution, the residual, does not necessarily converge equally fast for different frequencies.
	A solver can be very efficient on reducing the local error, while it takes many cycles to reduce the errors due to distant influence.
	A multigrid solver attacks this problem by applying iterative methods on different discretizations of the problem, by solving on a very coarse grids
	the error due to distant influence will be reduced faster, while solving on a fine grid reduces the local error fast. So by solving on both
	fine and coarse grids the needed cycles will be reduced. To implement a multigrid algorithm we then need algorithms to solver the problem on a grid \cref{sec:GSRB},
	restriction	\cref{sec:restr_simple} and prolongation \cref{sec:prol_simple} operators to transfer the problem between grids, as well as a method to compute the residual.


	\subsection{V-cycle}
		The simplest multigrid cycle is called a V-cycle, which starts at the finest grid, goes down to the coarsest grid and then goes back up
		to the finest grid.	First the problem is smoothed on the finest level, then we compute the residual, or the rest after inserting the guess solution
		in the equation. The residual is then used as the source term for the next level, and we restrict it down as the source term for the next
		coarser level and repeat untill we reach the coarsest level. When we reach the coarsest level the problem is solved there and we obtain a correction
		term. The correction term is prolongated to the next finer level and added to the solution there, improving the solution, following by a new smoothing
		to obtain a new correction. This continue untill we reach the finest level again and a multigrid cycle is completed, see \cref{fig:MG_schematic} for a 3
		level schematic.

		In the following description of the steps in the MG method, we will use \(\phi\), \(\rho\), \(d\) and \(\omega\) to signify the solution, source,
		defect and correction respectively. A subscript means the grid level, where \(0\) si the finest level, while the superscript \(0\) implies an initial guess is used. Hats and tildes are also
	 	used to signify the stage the solution is in, with a hat meaning the solution is smoothed and a tilde meaning the correction from the grid below is added.

		The operations necessary on a level in a multigrid cycle is given in \cref{tab:recursive}
		\begin{table}[h]
		\begin{tabular}	{l | c}
			\(1\): Smooth &\( \widehat{\phi}_l = \mathcal{S}(\phi_l, \rho_l)\)
			\\
			\(2\): Residual &	\(d_l = \nabla^2\widehat{\phi}_l - \rho_l\)
			\\
			\(3\): Restrict &\(\rho_{l+1} = \mathcal{R}d_l \) \nonumber
			\\
			\(4\): Go down, recieve correction & \(\omega_l = \mathcal{I} \phi_{l+1}\)
			\\
			\(5\): Add correction	&\(\widetilde{\phi}_l = \widehat{\phi}_l + \omega_l\)
			\\
			\(6\): Smooth	&\(\phi_l = \mathcal{S}(\widetilde{\phi}_l, \rho_l)\)
			\\
			\(7\): Interpolate correction &\( \omega_{l-1} = \mathcal{I} \phi_l\)
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{The operations done on each level in the multigrid cycle.}
		\label{tab:recursive}
		\end{table}

		At the coarsest level the the problem is solved directly and the correction is propageted upward.

		\subsection{Updating the Halo}
		All of the subgrids has a halo of ghostslayers around it, which is used to simplify boundary conditions and subdomain communication. Each computational node
		represents a subdomain of the whole, with the neighboring node being the boundary. So between two subdomains each subdomain updates the boundary according to
		the neigbouring subdomain. In addition the halo is used to facilitate boundary conditions on the whole domain. For some of the grid operators
		the ghost are not used, while some of them need updated values. All of the iterative solvers, that are used
		for smoothing, need updated values of the of the solution, \(\phi\). The prolongation and residual operators need updated values
		for the solution \(\phi\), and the restrictor need updated residual values, \(\rho\), as long as direct insertion is not used. (NOTE TO SELF: belong in paralellization part)
		We also need to take into account that the smoothers outputs an updated halo for \(\phi\), to avoid
		unnecessarily communication between the processors.

		\subsection{Implementation}
			In general there are \(4\) different quantities, the source, the solution, the residual and the correction, we need to keep track of.
			On each grid level the residual is computed, then it is set as the source term for the next level and then it is not used more.
			The correction, the improvement to the finer grid, is only used when going to a finer grid. Due to this we can save some memory by
			letting the correction and the residual share the same memory, so both are stored in the mgRes struct. There are a regular as well as a recursive implementation
			of a V-cycle. The functions takes the current level, the bottom of the cycle as well as the end point of the cycle. So several different cycles
			can be built from the functions. A W cycle can be built a V cycle that starts at the finest level and stops at a mid level, and then a new V-cycle is started at
			the mid level that ends at the finest level. A full multigrid algorithm (FMG) can also be implemented by first restricting the original source term down to the coarsest
			level and then run a V-cycle that ends at the finest level.
			(Note: there will be a a general mgSolver function pointer that can be set to prebuilt cycles, so the cycle can be set from the input file)

			The regular V cycle algorithm is quite straightforward, first it restricts and computes itself down to the bottom level,
			then it solves it directly on the bottom level. Then the correction is brought up and improved through the grid up to the top level.
			See \cref{sec:mg_V_regular} for an example code.

			The recursive algorithm uses an algorithm more similar to the one described in \cref{tab:recursive}. First it computes the steps necessary
			so the grid below has an updated source term, then it calls itself on a lower level. After recieving the correction from
			the lower level it is improved and sent to the level above. If the function is at the bottom level, it solves the problem directly and sends
			the correction up. See \cref{sec:mg_V_recursive} for an example code.
