\section{Scaling of the error compared to discretization}
The solver is solving a discretized problem, due to this the solution will not
be exact. The error will be of second order, \(\order{h^2}\), dependent on the
stepssize, \(h\), due to the first order solver, see \cref{sec:GSRB}.


To investigate that the error the of the solver follows a second order improvement
as the stepsize decreases we construct a sinusoidal rho as a test case.

\begin{equation}
    \rho(x) = \sin{\left(\frac{x}{2\pi}\right)}      \qquad ; \qquad x\epsilon[0,2\pi]
\end{equation}

This \(\rho\) is analytically solvable for the Poisson equation so we can compute the
\(2\)-norm of the error, \(\norm{err}_2\). Then we gradually decrease the stepsize
and obtain and compare the norm of the numerical solutions. Since the normalization in PinC
is normally done outside the multigrid solver, \(rho\) had to be suitably scaled
to the stepsize. We expect the error proportional to \(h^2\), so by taking the logarithm
we obtain

\begin{equation}
    \log(err(h)) = 2\log(Ch)
\end{equation}

where \(C\) is a constant dependent on \(\rho\).

    Both of the plots show a straight line of the error, on the logarithmic plots, with a slope
    of \(2.00\). This correspond to maximal error of \(\order{h^2}\)}
