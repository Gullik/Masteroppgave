\section{Plasma Oscillation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Plasma oscillates
    \item Randomly distributed plasma, with random velocities (Vel Causing a bug->Fix)
    \item Compute fitting Temperature and Debye length
\end{itemize}

    \subsection{Input parameters}
        \subsubsection{Timestep}
        First we need to ensure that the simulation is does not violate the time-
        stability criterion, \cref{sec:time_stability}, \(\Delta t \leq 2\omega_{pe}\).
        For computational reasons each particle in the program represents many real particles
        and we can adjust the number, of real particles represented, to ensure
        that the electron plasma frequency is \(1\).

        \begin{equation}
            \omega_{pe}^2 = \frac{nq^2_e}{m\epsilon_0} = \left(\frac{N}{V}\right)\left(\frac{q_{e*}}{m_{e*} }\right)q_{e*}
        \end{equation}

        Here \((N/V)\) is just the number of electron super-particles divided by the volume,
        \(q_e\) and \(m_e\), represents super-particles and needs to be multiplied by the number
        of particles in a super-particle, \(\kappa\).

        \begin{equation}
            \omega_{pe}^2 = \left(\frac{N}{V}\right)\left(\frac{e}{m_e}\right)\kappa e
        \end{equation}

        Since we want the electron plasma frequency to be \(1\), \(\kappa\) is set to

        \begin{equation}
            \kappa = \frac{Vm_e}{Ne^2}
        \end{equation}

        Now the time is given in units of \(\omega_{pe}\) and we use \(\Delta t = 0.2 < 2\) easily.

        \subsubsection{Spatial-step}
        The spatial step need to satisfy the finite grid instability condition,
        \(\Delta x < \varsigma \lambda_{Se}\), \cref{sec:finite_grid_instability}.
        We use a similar procedure as in normalizing the time with regards to \(\omega_{pe}\)
        to normalize the length with regards to \(\lambda_{Se}\). The we end up with
        the temperature, or its other representation as thermal velocity, as the parameter we can adjust to make sure that it satisfies the
        condition.

        \begin{equation}
            \lambda_{Se}^2 = \frac{\epsilon_0 kT_e}{nq^2_e}
        \end{equation}
