In this chapter we will go through different methods we used to verify the multigrid
solver, as well as scaling measurements. Modular parts of the solver is tested with unittests
where feasible. In addition the whole solver is tested with both analytically solvable
test cases and randomly generated fields.


\subsection{Error Quantification}
	\label{sec:errorQuant}
    (NOTE TO SELF: Tidy up)
	In order to evaluate solutions we will primarily look at the normalized 2-norm of the error, \cref{eq:2norm},
	and the residual, \cref{eq:barRes}. The \(\norm{ err }_2\) is computed from comparing the numerical
	solution \(\hat{\phi}\) to an analytical solution \(\phi\) and normalized with regards to grid points, \(N\).
	The residual is found by inserting the numerical solution into the Poisson equation, the remaining
	part is then the residual, and shows the difference of the current numerical solution
	and the optimal numerical solution.

	\begin{align}
		\norm{ err }_2&= \sqrt{\frac{\sum \left(\hat\phi - \phi\right)^2}{N}}  \label{eq:2norm}
		\\
		\bar{r} &= \frac{1}{N}\left( \sum_i{ \nabla^2 \hat{\phi}_i + \rho_i  }  \right) \label{eq:barRes}
	\end{align}
