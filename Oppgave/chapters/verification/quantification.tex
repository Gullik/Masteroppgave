\subsection{Error Quantification}
	\label{sec:errorQuant}
	In order to evaluate solutions we will primarily look at the normalized 2-norm of the error, \cref{eq:2norm},
	and the residual, \cref{eq:barRes}. The \(\norm{ e }_2\) is computed from comparing the numerical
	solution \(\widehat{\phi}\) to an analytical solution \(\phi\) and normalized with regards to grid points, \(N\).
	The residual is found by inserting the numerical solution into the Poisson equation, the remaining
	part is then the residual, and shows the difference of the current numerical solution
	and the optimal numerical solution.

	\begin{align}
		\norm{ e }_2&= \sqrt{\frac{\sum \left(\hat\phi - \phi\right)^2}{N}}  \label{eq:2norm}
		\\
		\bar{r} &= \frac{1}{N}\left( \sum_i{ \nabla^2 \widehat{\phi}_i + \rho_i  }  \right) \label{eq:barRes}
	\end{align}
