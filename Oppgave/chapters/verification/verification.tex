	% \subsection{Analytical Solutions}
	% 	We use a few different constructed charge density fields, which is analytically solvable,
	% 	to test the performance and correctness of the solver. All the simulations here are ran on
	% 	a grid of the size \( 128, 64, 64 \) divided into \(1,2,2\) subdomains.
 % 		It uses \(5\) cycles when presmoothing, solving on the coarsest grid and postsmoothing, the
	% 	MG solver is instructed to run for \(100\) MG V-cycles with \(2\) grid levels.
	%
	% \subsubsection{Sinusoidal function}
	% 	\label{sec:sinusoidal}
	% 	A sinusoidal source term, \(\rho\) can be useful to test the solver since
	% 	it can be constructed to have very simple derivatives and integrals. Here
	% 	we use a sinusoidal function that has two positive tops and two negative tops
	% 	over the total domain. We want the sinus function to go over \(1\) period
	% 	over the domain, so we normalize the argument by dividing the grid point
	% 	value, \(x_j, y_k, z_l\), by the domain length in the direction, \(L_x, L_y, L_z\).
	%
	% 	\begin{align}
	% 		\rho(x_j,y_j,z_l) &= \sin\left( x_j \frac{2\pi}{L_x} \right)\sin\left( y_{k} \frac{2\pi}{L_y} \right)
	% 		\intertext{A potential that fits with this is:}
	% 		\phi(x,y,z) &= -\left(\frac{2\pi}{L_x}\right)^2\left(\frac{2\pi}{L_y}\right)^2
 % 			\sin\left( x_j \frac{2\pi}{L_x} \right)\sin\left( y_{k} \frac{2\pi}{L_y} \right)
	% 	\end{align}

	% 	The \cref{fig:sinusoidal} shows the results from running the MG-solver on the test sinusoidal test case described here.
	% 	As can be expected the potential mirrors the charge distribution, except with an opposite sign and a larger amplitude.
	% 	A decently large grid was simulated and the mean residual was found to be: \(\bar{r} \approx 0.0312\).
	%
	%
	% 	\subsubsection{Heaviside Function}
	% 		The solver is also tested with a charge distribution governed by a Heaviside
	% 		function. This is also suited to testing since the charge distribution is then
	% 		constant planes, and we expect second order polynomial when integrating them.
	% 		In the test case there are two planes with the value \(-1\) and two
	% 		planes with \(1\). In \cref{fig:heaviside} the test case, as well as the solution and residual is
	% 		shown, and we can see the polynomials in the solution. The mean residual \(\bar{r}\) was
	% 		\(0.00677\).
	%
	% 	\begin{align}
	% 		\rho_(x_j,y_k,z_l) &= \begin{cases} 1  & y_j \epsilon (0, 32), (64,96)\\ -1  & y_j \epsilon (33, 65), (97,127) \end{cases}

	% 	\subsection{Random Charge distribution}
	% 		To hopefully avoid some problems, that could appear due to the earlier test
	% 		cases being to constructed being to orderly, a test with a randomized
	% 		charge distribution is also included. The \cref{fig:random} shows the
	% 		charge distribution, numerical potential and the residual. The mean residual was
 % 			found to be \(\bar{r} \approx 0.00388\).

% \section{Multigrid Solver}
% 	To test the solver itself we employ a couple different techniques. First we
% 	create a charge distribution by differentiating a known potential, and then
% 	running the solver and check if the resulting potential was equal to the original
% 	known potential.
%
% 	For the second test we use a charge distribution with a known analytical solution,
% 	and we then check that the solver reproduces the known analytical solution.
%
% 	A third method we use to verify it is to produce a random charge potential
% 	and then check that the potential converges, or in other words
% 	that the residual goes toward zero.
%
% 	Then lastly we use the solver on identical charge distributions with the domain
% 	divided up into different subdomains and check that the solver produces the same
% 	potential.
% \subsection{Predetermined Potential}
% 		In this section we first decide which potential we want, then numerically
% 		construct a corresponding charge potential by derivating. Then we compare the
% 		result with the original potential.

%
% The multigrid method has several different steps in the algorithm, as a developmental
% help and to ensure that the program works correctly during as many different conditions
% as possible we want to test the whole code, as well as the constituent parts where possible.
% The method is quite modular and several parts of it can be tested alone.
% The GS-RB, used for smoothing, can be independently tested, since on it's own it converges to a solution,
% just at a higher computational cost than the multigrid method. To test it we will
% use an initial density field with a length between the grid steps that results in
% an exact answer. The restriction and prolongation operators can also tested to a
% degree by checking that they preserve a constant grid through several grid level changes.

%
% \subsection{The Multigrid method}
% 	We use both of the aforemented tests to check that the whole multigrid method
% 	works as intended. Since a constant source term will give a trivial solution of
% 	the potential, \(\phi(x,y,z) = \va{0}\), we use that as a test. In addition we
% 	also test that it converges on a sinusoidal source term as we did the smoother.
%
%
% \subsection{Smoothers}
%
% 	The iterative method GS-RB used for the pre- and postsmoothing of the grid in
% 	our implementation of the multigrid method is also a direct solver.
% 	So we can test it, or most other smoothers, by testing them on a small system
% 	where the problem has an analytical solution. Then we can let them run for a
% 	while and ensure that they are converging towards the solution. If we let
% 	the source term be sinusoidal in one direction, and constant in the other
% 	directions it has an easy solution given below
%
% 	\begin{align}
% 		\nabla^2 \phi(x,y,z) &= \sin(x)
% 	\end{align}
%
% 	This has a solution when \(\phi(x,y,z) = -\sin(x)\) and we can test that the
% 	solver converges to the solution. If we let the source term be constant in the
% 	x direction and instead vary in the other directions we can get verify that the
% 	solver works in all three directions independently.
