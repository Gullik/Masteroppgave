In this chapter we will go through different methods we used to test and verify the multigrid
solver, as well as scaling measurements. Modular parts of the solver is tested with unittests
where feasible. In addition the whole solver is tested with both analytically solvable
test cases and randomly generated fields.

We also investigate the performance and scaling of the solver in the parallel environment.
This is to obtain a better understanding of how the field resolution can be scaled
up without hampering the perfomance of the particle-in-cell simulation to much.
We are interested in both how well the solver performs on a larger
number of processors, as well as the perfomance impact of the different
parameters in the solver.

%
% The multigrid method has several different steps in the algorithm, as a developmental
% help and to ensure that the program works correctly during as many different conditions
% as possible we want to test the whole code, as well as the constituent parts where possible.
% The method is quite modular and several parts of it can be tested alone.
% The GS-RB, used for smoothing, can be independently tested, since on it's own it converges to a solution,
% just at a higher computational cost than the multigrid method. To test it we will
% use an initial density field with a length between the grid steps that results in
% an exact answer. The restriction and prolongation operators can also tested to a
% degree by checking that they preserve a constant grid through several grid level changes.
%
%
% \subsection{The Multigrid method}
% 	We use both of the aforemented tests to check that the whole multigrid method
% 	works as intended. Since a constant source term will give a trivial solution of
% 	the potential, \(\phi(x,y,z) = \va{0}\), we use that as a test. In addition we
% 	also test that it converges on a sinusoidal source term as we did the smoother.
%
%
% \subsection{Smoothers}
%
% 	The iterative method GS-RB used for the pre- and postsmoothing of the grid in
% 	our implementation of the multigrid method is also a direct solver.
% 	So we can test it, or most other smoothers, by testing them on a small system
% 	where the problem has an analytical solution. Then we can let them run for a
% 	while and ensure that they are converging towards the solution. If we let
% 	the source term be sinusoidal in one direction, and constant in the other
% 	directions it has an easy solution given below
%
% 	\begin{align}
% 		\nabla^2 \phi(x,y,z) &= \sin(x)
% 	\end{align}
%
% 	This has a solution when \(\phi(x,y,z) = -\sin(x)\) and we can test that the
% 	solver converges to the solution. If we let the source term be constant in the
% 	x direction and instead vary in the other directions we can get verify that the
% 	solver works in all three directions independently.
