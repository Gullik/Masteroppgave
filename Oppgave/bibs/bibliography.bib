	abstract = {This textbook deals with the requirements of space physics. The first part starts with a description of the Earth's plasma environment, followed by a derivation of single particle motions in electromagnetic fields, with applications to the Earth's magnetosphere. Then the origin and effects of collisions and conductivities, formation of the ionosphere, magnetospheric convection and dynamics, and solar wind-magnetosphere coupling are discussed. The second part of the book presents a more theoretical foundation of plasma physics, starting from kinetic theory. Introducing moments of the distribution function permits derivation of the fluid equations, followed by an analysis of fluid boundaries, with the Earth's magnetopause and bow shock as examples. Finally, fluid and kinetic theory are applied to derive the relevant wave modes in a plasma. A representative selection of the many space plasma instabilities and relevant aspects of nonlinear theory is given in a companion textbook, Advanced Space Plasma Physics, by the same authors.},

The key to the efficiency of these algorithms is to construct appropriate base functions, which lead to systems with sparse matrices for the discrete variational formulations. The complexities of the algorithms are a small multiple of \$N{\textasciicircum}\{d + 1\} \$ operations for a d-dimensional domain with \$(N - 1){\textasciicircum}d \$ unknowns, while the convergence rates of the algorithms are exponential for problems with smooth solutions. In addition, the algorithms can be effectively parallelized since the bottlenecks of the algorithms are matrix-matrix multiplications.},

The worldwide fluctuations in the magnetic field are probably well explained in terms of hydromagnetic waves propagating through the magnetosphere in modes with the wave polarization current flowing perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. However, for the localized fluctuations such an interpretation is inconsistent with present theory of hydromagnetic wave propagation in the magnetosphere. We suggest that the observations of localized magnetic fluctuations might be better interpreted in terms of field-aligned currents in the magnetosphere.},
