@article{Diskin2001,
abstract = {This paper studies a novel multigrid approach to the solution for a second-order upwind-biased discretization of the convection equation in two dimensions. This approach is based on semi-coarsening and well-balanced explicit correction terms, added to coarse-grid operators to maintain on coarse grids the same cross-characteristic interaction as on the target (fine) grid. Multicolor relaxation schemes are used on all the levels, allowing a very efficient parallel implementation. The results of the smoothing analysis and numerical tests can be summarized as follows: (1) The residual asymptotic convergence rate is about 3 per cycle, which far surpasses the theoretical limit (4/3) predicted for standard multigrid algorithms with full-coarsening. (2) The full multigrid (FMG) algorithm with two V(0,2) cycles on the target grid and just one V(0,2) cycle on all the coarse grids always provides an approximate solution with the algebraic error less than the discretization error. (3) A novel algorithm for deriving a discrete solution approximating the true continuous solution with a relative accuracy given in advance is developed. The computational complexity of this algorithm is (nearly) optimal (comparable with the complexity of the FMG algorithm applied to solve the problem on the optimally spaced target grid). ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

@article{Kacem2012,
abstract = {Streamers dynamics are characterized by the fast propagation of ionized shock waves at the nanosecond scale under very sharp space charge variations. The streamer dynamics modelling needs the solution of charged particle transport equations coupled to the elliptic Poisson's equation. The latter has to be solved at each time step of the streamers evolution in order to follow the propagation of the resulting space charge electric field. In the present paper, a full multi grid (FMG) and a multi grid (MG) methods have been adapted to solve Poisson's equation for streamer discharge simulations between asymmetric electrodes. The validity of the FMG method for the computation of the potential field is first shown by performing direct comparisons with analytic solution of the Laplacian potential in the case of a point-to-plane geometry. The efficiency of the method is also compared with the classical successive over relaxation method (SOR) and MUltifrontal massively parallel solver (MUMPS). MG method is then applied in the case of the simulation of positive streamer propagation and its efficiency is evaluated from comparisons to SOR and MUMPS methods in the chosen point-to-plane configuration. Very good agreements are obtained between the three methods for all electro-hydrodynamics characteristics of the streamer during its propagation in the inter-electrode gap. However in the case of MG method, the computational time to solve the Poisson's equation is at least 2 times faster in our simulation conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Martin1997,
abstract = {The large number of processing elements in current parallel
systems necessitates the development of more comprehensive and realistic
tools for the scalability analysis of algorithms on those architectures.
This paper presents a simple analytical tool with which to study the
scalability of parallel algorithm-architecture combinations. Our
practical method studies separately execution time, efficiency, and
memory usage in the accuracy-critical scaling model, where the problem
size-input data set size-increases with the number of processors, which
is the relevant one in many situations. The paper defines quantitative
and qualitative measurements of the scalability and derives important
relationships between execution time and efficiency. For example,
results show that the best way to scale the system (to deteriorate as
little as possible the properties of the system) is by maintaining
constant execution time. These analytical results are verified with one
candidate application for massive parallel computers: the full multigrid
method. We study the scalability of a general d-dimensional full
multigrid method on an r-dimensional mesh of processors. The analytical
expressions are verified through experimental results obtained by
implementing the full multigrid method on a Transputer-based machine and
on the CRAY T3D},

@article{Tezduyar2008,
abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},
