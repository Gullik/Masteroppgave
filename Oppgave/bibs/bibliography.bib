abstract = {SUMMARY: The example books published as part of the Numerical Recipes second edition series contain source programs that exercise and demonstrate all of the Numerical Recipes subroutines. Each example program contains comments and is prefaced by a short description of what it does. The books contain all of the old material from the original edition as well as new material from the second edition. They will be valuable for readers who wish to incorporate procedures and subroutines into their own source programs. They are available in both FORTRAN and C.},
