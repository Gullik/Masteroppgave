Such a code provides good resolution all over phase space, including very low density regions where particle‐in‐cell codes simply run out of calculation particles. This resolution is important for these problems because of the intense interest in the highly accelerated electrons. In this paper the emphasis is on the development of the Vlasov code for a bounded plasma, which is much more realistic than the periodic, initial‐value case treated in an earlier publication.},

Then the origin and effects of collisions and conductivities, formation of the ionosphere, magnetospheric convection and dynamics, and solar wind-magnetosphere coupling are discussed. The second part of the book presents a more theoretical foundation of plasma physics, starting from kinetic theory. Introducing moments of the distribution function permits derivation of the fluid equations, followed by an analysis of fluid boundaries, with the Earth's magnetopause and bow shock as examples. Finally, fluid and kinetic theory are applied to derive the relevant wave modes in a plasma. A representative selection of the many space plasma instabilities and relevant aspects of nonlinear theory is given in a companion textbook, Advanced Space Plasma Physics, by the same authors.},

	abstract = {Computer simulation of systems has become an important tool in scientific research and engineering design, including the simulation of systems through the motion of their constituent particles. Important examples of this are the motion of stars in galaxies, ions in hot gas plasmas, electrons in semiconductor devices, and atoms in solids and liquids. The behavior of the system is studied by programming into the computer a model of the system and then performing experiments with this model. New scientific insight is obtained by observing such computer experiments, often for controlled conditions that are not accessible in the laboratory. Computer Simulation using Particles deals with the simulation of systems by following the motion of their constituent particles. This book provides an introduction to simulation using particles based on the NGP, CIC, and P3M algorithms and the programming principles that assist with the preparations of large simulation programs based on the OLYMPUS methodology. It also includes case study examples in the fields of astrophysics, plasmas, semiconductors, and ionic solids as well as more detailed mathematical treatment of the models, such as their errors, dispersion, and optimization.This resource will help you understand how engineering design can be assisted by the ability to predict performance using the computer model before embarking on costly and time-consuming manufacture.},

The "turbulent" flow pattern created, eventually, under nonlinear conditions is calculated numerically, demonstrating the tendency towards randomization of the initial drift energy.

The complexities of the algorithms are a small multiple of \$N{\textasciicircum}\{d + 1\} \$ operations for a d-dimensional domain with \$(N - 1){\textasciicircum}d \$ unknowns, while the convergence rates of the algorithms are exponential for problems with smooth solutions.

The worldwide fluctuations in the magnetic field are probably well explained in terms of hydromagnetic waves propagating through the magnetosphere in modes with the wave polarization current flowing perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. However, for the localized fluctuations such an interpretation is inconsistent with present theory of hydromagnetic wave propagation in the magnetosphere. We suggest that the observations of localized magnetic fluctuations might be better interpreted in terms of field-aligned currents in the magnetosphere.},

	abstract = {A new three-dimensional magnetohyrodynamic (MHD) simulation code based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta-Gill time advance and the direct finite space difference is applied to the detailed study of the solar wind interaction with the Earth's dipole field with special emphasis on its numerical soundness. The dynamic formation processes of the bow shock and the magnetopause are revealed, where the transient propagation characteristics of fast waves play the leading role. The plasma sheet formation process is also revealed. The high temperature, high density, and hence high pressure in the plasma sheet are caused by the fast waves which compress the dipole field. The study of the effects of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) on the plasma sheet finds that when the IMF is directed south, the plasma sheet is strongly compressed by the reconnected magnetic flux which is carried from the day side. The peak plasma sheet pressure that appears around 8 RE (RE∶ Earth's radius) on the nightside is almost exactly as large as the solar wind dynamic pressure in the absence of the IMF. When the IMF is north, the nightside lobe magnetic field is peeled off, so that the plasma sheet pressure becomes weakly depressed in comparison with the no-IMF case. This indicates that the direction of the IMF largely influences the pressure of the plasma sheet. More interestingly and importantly, no Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs along the magnetopause in an ideal MHD, contrary to the conventional understanding. Furthermore, no entry of mass, momentum, and energy through the magnetopause is observed at all in our simulation. This strongly ensures enough numerical accuracy and validity of the present work. Thus the simulation results of earlier works where a considerable amount of solar wind momentum is transported into the magnetosphere must be due to a numerical inaccuracy. As further evidence showing the numerical validity of the present code, the relationship between the standoff distance and the adiabatic constant is compared with the strong shock theory, and a fairly good agreement is obtained. On the other hand, the standoff distance is found to be weakly dependent upon the dynamic pressure of the solar wind in the realistic parameter range.},

The thermalizing properties and ergodic behavior of the system are examined and found to be in agreement with the assumption that one is equally likely to find the system in equal volumes of the available phase space. The velocity distribution, Debye shielding, drag on fast and slow sheets, diffusion in velocity space, the Landau damping of the Fourier modes, the amplitude distribution function for the Fourier modes, and the distribution of electric fields felt by the sheets were obtained for the plasma in thermal equilibrium and compared with theoretically predicted values. In every case, except one, the drag on a slow sheet, the numerical results agreed with theory to within the statistical accuracy of the results. The numerical results for the drag on a slow sheet were about a factor of 2 lower than the theory predicated indicating that the approximations made in the theory are not entirely valid. An understanding of the cause of the discrepancy might lead to a better understanding of collisional processes in plasmas.},

	abstract = {In order to use particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation codes for modeling collisional plasmas and self-sustained discharges, it is necessary to add interactions between charged and neutral particles. In conventional Monte Carlo schemes the time or distance between collisions for each particle is calculated using random numbers. This procedure allows for efficient algorithms but is not compatible with PIC simulations where the charged particle trajectories are all integrated simultaneously in time. A Monte Carlo collision (MCC) package including the null collision method has been developed, as an addition to the usual PIC charged particle scheme which will be discussed here. We will also present results from simulations of argon and oxygen discharges, and compare our argon simulation results with experimental measurements.},

This book looks at non-relativistic, fully ionized, nondegenerate, quasi-neutral, and weakly coupled plasma. Intended for the student market, the text provides a concise and cohesive introduction to plasma physics theory, and offers a solid foundation for students wishing to take higher level courses in plasma physics.   Mathematically Rigorous, but Driven by Physics  This work contains over 80 exercises―carefully selected for their pedagogical value―with fully worked out solutions available in a separate solutions manual for professors. The author provides an in-depth discussion of the various fluid theories typically used in plasma physics. The material presents a number of applications, and works through specific topics including basic plasma parameters, the theory of charged particle motion in inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields, plasma fluid theory, electromagnetic waves in cold plasmas, electromagnetic wave propagation through inhomogeneous plasmas, magnetohydrodynamical fluid theory, and kinetic theory.
