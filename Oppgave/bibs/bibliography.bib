	abstract = {This paper presents some efficient algorithms based on the Legendre–Galerkin approximations for the direct solution of the second- and fourth-order elliptic equations. The key to the efficiency of these algorithms is to construct appropriate base functions, which lead to systems with sparse matrices for the discrete variational formulations. The complexities of the algorithms are a small multiple of \$N{\textasciicircum}\{d + 1\} \$ operations for a d-dimensional domain with \$(N - 1){\textasciicircum}d \$ unknowns, while the convergence rates of the algorithms are exponential for problems with smooth solutions. In addition, the algorithms can be effectively parallelized since the bottlenecks of the algorithms are matrix-matrix multiplications.},

Every such system uses trans-ionospheric propagation of radio waves, waves which must traverse the commonly turbulent ionosphere. Understanding this turbulence and predicting it are one of the major goals of the National Space Weather program. Acquiring such a prediction capability will rest on understanding the very topics of this book, the plasma physics and electrodynamics of the system.*Fully updated to reflect advances in the field in the 20 years since the first edition published*Explores the buffeting of the ionosphere from above by the sun and from below by the lower atmosphere*Unique text appropriate both as a reference and for coursework.},

The text’s six sections lead readers systematically and comprehensively through the fundamentals of modern plasma physics. Sections on single-particle motion, plasmas as fluids, and collisional processes in plasmas lay the groundwork for a thorough understanding of the subject. The authors take care to place the material in its historical context for a rich understanding of the ideas presented. They also emphasize the importance of medical imaging in radiotherapy, providing a logical link to more advanced works in the area. The text includes problems, tables, and illustrations as well as a thorough index and a complete list of references.},
